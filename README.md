Build & Deploy Your First Decentralized Election Voting DApp | Solidity, Next.js, Hardhat

Dive into the world of blockchain development by creating your very own decentralized election voting DApp. In this tutorial, we will guide you through the entire process of building and deploying a secure and transparent voting application using Solidity for smart contracts, Hardhat for development and testing, and Next.js for the frontend. Perfect for beginners and seasoned developers alike, this video covers:

- Writing and deploying smart contracts in Solidity
- Setting up a development environment with Hardhat
- Building a responsive frontend with Next.js
- Connecting your DApp to the Ethereum network
